			<h1>Game of Life</h1>
			<p>
				<br>
				The Game of Life, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life">Conway's The Game of Life</a>, is a "life simulation" devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. 
				<br><br>
				This game is not your typical video game. It demonstrates how complex structures can be created with few simple rules, just like how our universe creates its complexity with just a few laws of physics.
				<br><br>
			</p>
			<h3>Rules</h3>
			<p>
				The universe of the Game of Life is an two-dimensional matrix of cells, each of which is either live or dead. Every cell interacts with its eight neighbours. At each step, the following rules apply:
				<ul>
					<li>Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by underpopulation.</li>
					<li>Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.</li>
					<li>Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.</li>
					<li>Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.</li>
				</ul>
				<br>
			</p>
